      "dict_values([{'messages': AIMessage(content=\"## A2A Agents: Mastering the Art of Agent-to-Agent Communication\\n\\nA2A agents, short for **Agent-to-Agent** agents, represent a fascinating and increasingly important area in artificial intelligence. \\n\\nEssentially, A2A agents are autonomous software entities that can **communicate and collaborate with each other** to achieve common goals. Unlike traditional agents that primarily interact with the environment, A2A agents focus on **inter-agent interaction**, forming complex networks and ecosystems.\\n\\nHere's a breakdown of key aspects of A2A agents:\\n\\n**1. Purpose and Functionality:**\\n\\n* **Collaboration:** A2A agents can work together to solve problems that are too complex for a single agent to handle.\\n* **Resource Sharing:** Agents can share information, resources, and even tasks to optimize efficiency.\\n* **Task Specialization:** Agents can specialize in specific tasks, allowing for division of labor and improved performance.\\n* **Emergent Behavior:** Through interactions, A2A agents can exhibit emergent behavior, producing complex outcomes not explicitly programmed.\\n\\n**2. Communication and Interaction:**\\n\\n* **Messaging Systems:** Agents typically communicate through structured messages, exchanging information about their state, goals, and intentions.\\n* **Contract-based Interaction:** Agents can establish contracts outlining their responsibilities and expectations, ensuring clear communication and accountability.\\n* **Negotiation and Bargaining:** Agents can negotiate with each other to allocate resources, resolve conflicts, and reach agreements.\\n\\n**3.
